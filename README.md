If you want, I can:
- Create this profile README file for you in a new repository named ShivamXploit (public) and add these starter links (I‚Äôll need permission to access your account or you can authorize via gh/CLI), or
- Generate filled-in project READMEs for each featured repo (ctf-writeups, recon-scripts, detection-rules) and a CONTRIBUTING/SECURITY template to include there.

Which would you like me to do next?
